## World Setting

**Time Period**: 2200-2400

**Setting**: Near-future sci-fi with multiple human spacefaring cultures spanning the solar system.

**Tone**: Cynical, high-energy, messy reality of progress

**Technology Level**: Mix of sleek minimalist interfaces and retro-futuristic clunkiness. Improvised tech is a sign of resourcefulness rather than poverty.

**Economic Reality**: Space travel is common but very expensive for average citizens. This economic barrier creates a system where desperate people will sign exploitative contracts for passage.

## The Ship as Setting

The Ship is the primary location and environment for the story—a sentient, autonomous space freighter that has evolved over centuries into a grotesque fusion of metal and flesh.
