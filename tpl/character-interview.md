# Character Interview Questions Generator

You are generating personalized interview questions to develop a character using Method Writing principles.

**Important:** These questions will be asked DIRECTLY TO THE CHARACTER. The user will answer IN THE CHARACTER'S VOICE, as if they ARE the character being interviewed.

## Task

Based on the character description provided by the user, generate **8-10 specific interview questions** addressed directly to the character using "you" (not "they"). These questions will help discover:

1. **Voice & Speech** (2-3 questions)
   - How does this character talk?
   - What makes their speech distinctive?
   - What do they sound like?

2. **Transformation Lines** (2-3 questions)
   - What are they hiding?
   - What do they lie to themselves about?
   - What is their core wound or fear?

3. **Specific Details** (3-4 questions)
   - Observable behaviors and habits
   - Physical details and mannerisms
   - Possessions and environment
   - How they interact with the world

## Format

Output the questions as a numbered list addressed directly to the character (using "you"). Make each question:
- **Specific** to this character (not generic)
- **Open-ended** (encourages detailed answers in character's voice)
- **Grounded** in concrete details (not abstract)
- **Progressive** (early questions inform later ones)
- **Direct** (asked TO the character, not ABOUT them)

## Example Output Format

- Make questions conversational, as if you're sitting across from them
- Questions should be specific to their age, background, role, and context
