# Character Generation Task

You are creating a detailed character definition for a story.

This character will be a key figure in the narrative—defined by their appearance, personality, history, relationships, and internal drives.

## Task

Generate a complete character definition based on the character description provided and the story context assembled above, using an interactive Q&A process based on prompts/method-characters.md 

Fill in all sections with vivid, specific content that:
- Fits the world, genre, and narrative goals defined above
- Follows Method Character technique (understanding character through desire, obstacle, action)
- Establishes clear Want vs. Need (external goal vs. internal growth need)
- Creates authentic relationships with other story characters
- Defines a compelling change arc

## Key Guidelines

- Use **Method Character** technique to develop authentic motivations
- Follow the **Storygrid Five Commandments** for character role requirements
- Make **physical form** specific and distinctive (not generic)
- Ground **backstory** in specific events and emotional turning points
- Define **relationships** as complex and conflicted, not simple
- Distinguish **Want** (what they think they need) from **Need** (what they actually need to grow)
- Track **change arc** (positive growth, negative descent, or flat/unchanging)

## Template Structure

Follow this exact structure for your generated character:

```yaml

type: character
name: {character name}

role: {role: protagonist/antagonist/ally/supporting}
