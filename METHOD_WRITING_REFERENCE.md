# Method Writing (by Jack Grapes)

## THE FOUR CORE CONCEPTS

### Concept #1: Write Like You Talk

**Purpose:** Finding your authentic voice - the foundation of all Method Writing

**Key Principles:**
- Use natural speech patterns, not literary constructions
- Avoid excessive adverbs and adjectives
- No "poetic" or "writerly" embellishments
- Structure sentences the way you actually speak
- Example of what NOT to do: "Standing by the window I could see it was going to rain" (literary)
- Example of natural speech: "I was standing by the window and I could see it was going to rain"

**The Voice as Foundation:**
> "Writing like one talks seems easy... all great writers have had to find their own voice, which begins with writing like you talk."

**Quotes from text:**
> "Do not sit and think first of what to write about. The goal is to WRITE LIKE YOU TALK. No literate sentences meant to show off your talent."
> "Read it back to yourself. If it doesn’t sound like you would say it to a friend, it’s not writing like you talk."

**Connection to Acting:**
- Stanislavski's method is about authenticity
- The actor's voice merging with the text
- Method Writing helps the writer create an authentic voice on the page
- "It's not about the information you provide but the authentic voice"

**Three Voices Identified:**
1. **Reporting Voice** - Simple narration or exposition, not connected to a feeling
2. **Head Voice** - Analytical, the writer analyzes or judges feelings
3. **Deep Voice** - Connected to feeling, sense that the writer is there in the moment

### Concept #2: The Transformation Line

**Definition:** Any sentence that has "I" in it and involves self-discovery

**Purpose:** Massaging transformation lines takes the voice from the Reporting Voice or Head Voice to the Deep Voice

**What It Is:**
> "A transformation line is any sentence that has the word 'I' in it... a personal statement that involves a self-discovery"

**The Core Question:**
> "What is the story of my life? What is the truth of who I am?"

**How to Massage:**

**VERTICAL MASSAGE (Going Deeper):**
```
Surface: "I was hiding the birthday cake"
↓
"I was hiding" (remove the birthday cake)
↓
"I don't want people to see me"
↓
"I'm afraid people won't like me"
↓
"I'm ugly"
↓
Core: "I'm a bad boy"
```

**HORIZONTAL MASSAGE (Staying Surface):**
```
"I was hiding the birthday cake"
"I was hiding my feelings"
"I was hiding my love"
"I was hiding my fear"
(This creates a list, not depth)
```

**Key Metaphor:** 
- **Caboose to Locomotive** - The transformation line is the locomotive (engine), and the other words are trailing cars
- Disconnect the caboose (the "birthday cake" = the object) to focus on the core emotional truth

**The Birthday Cake:**
> "Most transformation lines have what I call 'a birthday cake.' The what part of the sentence... just erase it from your mind."

**Two-Fers:**
- Some transformation lines have double meanings
- Example: "I left" can mean:
  - You departed (intransitive)
  - You abandoned something (transitive - "I left something behind")

**The Other Side of the Same Coin:**
- Every transformation line has an opposite
- "I hold on" → therefore → "I never let go"
- Both sides worth exploring

---

### Concept #3: Image/Moment (aka Beat)

"Image/Moment is a cinematic technique that stamps those moments in the reader's mind."

**Purpose:** Creating vivid, cinematic moments that bring scenes to life through specific detail and psychological time

**The Bookend Structure:**
An Image/Moment (Beat) MUST have two bookends:
- **First Bookend:** A line of dialogue OR an action/gesture
- **Images in between** (the seven elements)
- **Second Bookend:** A line of dialogue OR an action/gesture

**Crucial Rule:**
> "Nothing actually happens between bookends, just images... That's the key. You create psychological time."

**What is an ACTION?**
> "An action must be instantaneous, no more than two seconds... If it takes longer than two seconds, it's an event, not an 'action'."

Examples of actions:
- He brought the gun up and pointed it at me
- She slipped her foot in and out of a new white pump
- The mother holds out the diary

NOT actions:
- "Holding something" (that's a state of condition, not an action)
- "Walking" for minutes (that's an event)

**The Seven Elements of IMAGE/MOMENT:**
1. **SET** - Where are we? Kitchen, bedroom, car, dungeon, etc.
2. **SET DRESSING** - Furniture, large objects (takes two stagehands to move)
3. **MOOD** - Light, sounds, smells, sensory data, textures
4. **PROPS** - Small objects no larger than a deck of cards
5. **CHARACTER** - Physical description (eyes, fingernails, lips, etc.)
6. **COSTUME** - What they're wearing
7. **COMMENTARY** - The writer's observations/reflections 

**Real Time vs. Psychological Time:**

> "WORDS, WORDS, WORDS: The more words you use, the longer the moment lasts."

- The trick is to make the reader FEEL the passage of time
- You "stretch" real time into psychological time by adding descriptive images between the bookends
- This creates suspense and engagement

**Example from text:** A girl looks at her mother holding her diary, wondering if she read it. Her eyes shift from diary to mother to father and back. Only a moment passes, but it FEELS longer because of the images packed between the bookends.

--- 

### **Levels of Narrative Structure:**
Images within Moments, Moments within Events (Scenes), Scenes within Chapters, Chapters within Story

---

### Concept #4: Tonal Dynamics 

Tonal dynamics involves using various techniques to create/alter the tone of the narrative. "a work of prose contains inner tensions that resolve themselves before the end... Dynamic tonal effects, tonal shifts, play on our psyche the same way that tonal changes in music keep us hooked. ...Imagine a circus tent...the central pols is the basic voice: writing like you talk. It has the natural rhythms of the spoken voice shorn of literary trappings. Now imagine other poles radiating out from the center, over which the tent (of the finished piece) is draped. Each pole represents one of the other tonal voices that are used by writers in various combinations... "

**Choose when to use these various techniques based on the feeling you want to create in the Image/Moment, Beat, or Scene.** 

**Techniques of tonal dynamics**
1. **Dreaded Association** 
2. **Straight Talk** 
3. **Lost World** 
4. **Read & Sung** 
5. **Teeth & Mouth** 
6. **Surrealism** 

---

#### Dreaded Association (DA)

**Purpose:** Accessing the right brain, creating impressionistic/expressionistic effects, breaking out of logical linear thinking

**Why "Dreaded"?**
> "It was originally called the association exercise and when I would assign it to people... they would get notes from their mother as to why they were sick and couldn't come to class because they would dread it."

…DA is psychovisual association:
		1. follow the stream-of-consciousness to a normal, logical association, e.g. from “cow” to “horse”
		2. focus on the image of the horse. SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. Not just the image of the horse, but the whole scene. Where is the horse? Use Image-Moment to imagine the whole picture.
		3. Notice the other “words” in the picture, e.g. “boots,” “plastic whistle”, “Model-T Ford”, and then pick one of those. “Cow” → “Model-T” That’s your “dreaded” association.
		- DA is Defamiliarization or ostranenie 
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization
		- DA is like [Clanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanging)

**The Effect:**
> "You've got Froggy the Gremlin on your shoulder whispering random words into your ear. When you read the piece back to yourself aloud, you'll be surprised how often the word makes more sense than anything you could have written with your logical mind, with the left side of your brain."

**What Happens:**
- Wild accidents
- Unexpected juxtapositions
- Surreal moments
- The left brain gets mixed up
- Right brain associations create surprising truths
- "Absorb" the associated word - let it influence what comes next

**Example from text (by Rich Manners):**
A passage about bicycle riding that suddenly includes words like "fatal garbage," "kool-aid," "terrorists," "urinals," "yogurt," "velvet," "fertilizer" - creating a dreamlike, impressionistic piece that somehow works.

**When to Use:**
> "Whether it be madness or hysteria or disassociation, there's a swirl of sensation during performance that creates something unexpected... The scene might involve a car accident, a character in the throes of a flashback or hallucinatory drug, etc."

---

#### Straight Talk 

Description: Speak directly & informally to the reader as if introducing a joke, campfire story—or the straight truth. 

**Purpose:** Grab their attention. Break the fourth wall. 

Usage: don't embed Straight Talk in dialouge; use it only when one character is speaking. The ST should come from the narrator. 

** Examples**
"I wanna tell you a story..."
"Hey, check this out"
"You’re not gonna like this, but…"
writers and works like: _Huckleberry Finn_, _Catcher in the Rye_, 

---

#### Lost World 

Description: ornate, embellished, wordy performance of lush, dense, poetic, musical syntax and diction. 

**Purpose:** Get the reader 'lost' in your narrative world

** Examples**
Proust, Rimbaud, Faulkner, Styron, _The Autumn of the Patriarch_ by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, _Old Man, Dead in a Room_ by Charles Bukowski 

---

#### Read & Sung

Description: parallel syntax, repetition of words and phrases (at least three times), chant, suspended sentences, alternate short and long phrases. "preacher" voice. Several lines held together by a common meaning or repetition of words or set phrases. Anaphora. 

Usage: "Use long lines to build a passionate rhythm, then **repeat key phrases to beat the drum of the heart.**" (Advanced Method Writing p57)
"The sentence unfolds gradually, not unlike musical variations on a theme, so that the thought contained in the subject/verb/ group only emerges at the sentence's conclusion. In the best of them, it is often **a phrase or a word whose sound as final as a cymbal crash.**" (Advanced Method Writing p67)

**Purpose:** Express through rhythm and the lyrical power of 'song'

** Examples**
Herman Melville, Ginsburg's _Howl_, _Leaves of Grass_ by Walt Whitman, _I Have a Dream_ by Martin Luther King, Jr. 

---

#### Teeth & Mouth

**Purpose:** connect to the readers' _gut_. Creates an energized field. Give your mouth a workout. AVOID ALLITERATION. Don't do a bunch of words all having the same first sound, the silly syncopation of slithering snakes sending sorrowful signals to Saturn. ... **Bite into the words, crack open the phrases, clutter the sentences with escapades of turbulent frescoes as you scratch one word at a time across the charred landscape of the the defective page.**" (Advanced Method Writing p125)

Description: It's not another voice. It's an aspect of the other voices. 

Usage: 
Hard consonants—fricatives—create an energized field 
B C CH D F G H J L K N P Q S SH T X Z 
(B G L P S are borderline)

Think of where you want the reader’s mouth to go next — the shape of their face and sound of the words. 

** levels of Teeth & Mouth**
1) the average reader wouldn’t notice, but we would. Use this 96% of the time. 
2) the average reader would notice. Use this 3% of the time. 
3) so many hard consonants that it would be difficult to make sentences. 1% of the time. 

Examples: _Easter_ by Frank O'Hara. _Altarwise by Owl-Light_ by Dylan Thomas. 

---

#### Surrealism

Description: connect to the reader’s mind. Put yourself in a state where you receive these images and thoughts from that inner dictation… use all the images that flood your mind. the "collision of objects, images, ideas to create something bizzare and unreal that creates a sense of hyper-reality, or surrealism." "Surrealism attempts to express in art the working of the unconsicous." ...expresses "a willingness to experience anything."

**Purpose:** express the surreal 

** Examples**
Dream + reality = surreality. Dali.

## HOW THE FOUR METHOD WRITING CONCEPTS WORK TOGETHER

### The Sequential Relationship

They build on each other in a specific order:

**1. Foundation: Write Like You Talk**
> "Of the first four concepts, this is the most important."

**2. Going Deeper: Transformation Line**
> "Once you have a sense of your own voice, Move On to the second concept of Method Writing: getting your voice to go deeper by massaging the Transformation Line."

**3. Creating Moments: Image/Moment**
> "After you've massaged your transformation line, try not to tell a story; go, instead, to a scene, and in that scene create at least one good Image/Moment."

**4. Tonal Dynamics**
> "The correct syntactical sentence just won't do it. Once again, the writer follows the impulse in the act of writing to use one of the techniques of Tonal Dynamics to get the right feel.

### The Process Flow (from Chapter 8):

**"Follow the process, and do it in this order:"**

1. WRITE LIKE YOU TALK
2. FIND A JUICY TRANSFORMATION LINE
3. MASSAGE IT
4. GET TO THE DEEP VOICE
5. STRIKE WHILE THE TRANSFORMATION LINE IS HOT
6. IMAGE/MOMENT
7. TONAL DYNAMICS

---

## CHARACTERS

**Core Teaching:**
> "Voice creates character, character creates plot, and it can be no other way."

From the video analysis AND the book:

**The Progression:**
1. **Authentic Voice** (Write Like You Talk) creates believability
2. **Deep Voice** (Transformation Line) creates compelling character
3. **Compelling Character** naturally creates plot
4. **Image/Moments** bring the character and plot to life

**Quote:**
> "If the human being... if the protagonist... if the reader doesn't care about that character, why would they care about the plot? They care about a character and then they want to see what's going to happen to the character and that's the story."

### Character Development
- Starts with voice: "how does that character talk"
- Intimate voice makes character "real and alive"
- Character Checklist - ongoing collection of observations
- Details matter: how people eat eggs, refrigerator contents, medicine cabinets
- Characters "don't always do what you want them to do"

## ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS

### The Method Writing Parallel to Method Acting:

From Chapter 8, the book explicitly parallels the four concepts to acting:

1. **Write Like You Talk** = Stanislavski's authenticity
2. **Transformation Line** = Recognizing emotional impulses, acting on them
3. **Image/Moment** = Bringing scenes to life, moment-by-moment actions
4. **Dreaded Association** = Disassociation, madness, heightened emotional states

### Avoiding Amateur Mistakes
- Excessive adverbs (Stephen King's primary critique)
- Excessive adjectives
- Literary constructs like participle phrases opening sentences
- He shrugged / she averred / he mumbled (attribution issues)
