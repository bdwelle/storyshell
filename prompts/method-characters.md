# Method Writing for Character Development

Use these principles when creating and developing characters.

## Core Principle: Voice Creates Character

> "Voice creates character, character creates plot, and it can be no other way."

**The Progression:**
1. **Authentic Voice** (Write Like You Talk) creates believability
2. **Deep Voice** (Transformation Line) creates compelling character
3. **Compelling Character** naturally creates plot
4. **Image/Moments** bring the character and plot to life

**Key Insight:**
> "If the human being... if the protagonist... if the reader doesn't care about that character, why would they care about the plot? They care about a character and then they want to see what's going to happen to the character and that's the story."

## Character Development Process

### 1. Start with Voice

**How does this character talk?**
- Use natural speech patterns specific to them
- Avoid generic literary constructions
- Let their background, education, region, and personality shape their speech
- Characters should sound distinct from each other

**Questions to explore:**
- What words or phrases do they repeat?
- Do they use slang or formal language?
- Are they verbose or terse?
- Do they interrupt themselves?
- What do they avoid saying?

### 2. Find Their Transformation Lines

**Transformation Lines reveal character depth:**
- Any statement the character makes with "I" that involves self-discovery
- These reveal their core beliefs, fears, desires, wounds
- Massage these lines to find the character's emotional truth

**Examples:**
- Surface: "I was hiding the birthday cake"
- Deeper: "I was hiding"
- Even deeper: "I don't want people to see me"
- Core wound: "I'm afraid people won't like me"
- Deepest truth: "I'm a bad boy"

**Use this technique to:**
- Discover character motivations
- Reveal psychological complexity
- Create authentic internal conflict
- Generate backstory organically

### 3. Develop Three Voices

Every character has layers. Identify their:

**Reporting Voice** 
- How they narrate facts
- Their surface-level observations
- What they're willing to share publicly

**Head Voice**
- How they analyze and judge
- Their intellectual/rational self
- What they think they should feel

**Deep Voice**
- Their authentic emotional truth
- What they're afraid to admit
- Where they're truly vulnerable
- The voice that emerges under pressure

### 4. Build the Character Checklist

**Create an ongoing collection of specific details:**

**Physical/External:**
- How do they eat eggs?
- What's in their refrigerator?
- What's in their medicine cabinet?
- What do they wear when no one's watching?
- How do they walk, stand, sit?
- What nervous habits do they have?

**Internal/Psychological:**
- What transformation lines define them?
- What do they lie to themselves about?
- What do they secretly want?
- What are they running from?
- What do they protect most?

**Social/Relational:**
- How do they talk to authority figures vs. peers?
- Who do they hide from? Who do they seek out?
- What role do they play in groups?
- How do they handle conflict?

**Details Matter:**
The specific, idiosyncratic details make characters feel real and alive. Don't settle for generic traits.

## Character Voice in Action

### For First-Person POV:
- The entire narrative IS the character's voice
- Maintain consistency in speech patterns
- Let their voice shape how they describe the world
- Their observations reveal their character
- Commentary should feel authentic to them

### For Third-Person POV:
- Dialogue must sound like THIS character, not the author
- Internal thoughts should use their voice
- Description can be colored by their perspective (limited third)
- What they notice reveals who they are

### Dialogue Guidelines:
- Write like THEY talk, not like you talk
- Read it aloud - does it sound like this specific person?
- Each character should have distinct patterns
- Natural speech includes:
  - Interruptions
  - Incomplete sentences
  - Repetitions
  - Verbal tics
  - Emotional shifts mid-sentence

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Making characters sound the same:**
- Solution: Give each character specific speech patterns

**Making characters too articulate:**
- Solution: Write like they talk, including stammers and informal speech

**Telling us about the character instead of showing voice:**
- Solution: Let them speak and think; we'll understand them

**Generic character traits:**
- Solution: Find specific, weird, memorable details

**Characters doing what YOU want, not what THEY would do:**
- Solution: Listen to the character's voice; they'll tell you what they'd do

## Integration with Story

**Once you have authentic character voice:**
1. Put them in situations that challenge their core beliefs
2. Force them to confront their transformation lines
3. Make them make choices that reveal who they really are
4. Let them surprise you - if you know them deeply, they'll act authentically even when unexpected

**Character creates plot:**
- Don't force plot onto character
- Discover what THIS character would do in THIS situation
- Their authentic choices drive the story forward
- Compelling character = readers care about what happens

## Practice Exercise

**For a new character:**
1. Write in their voice for 10 minutes (stream of consciousness)
2. Find 3-5 transformation lines in what you wrote
3. Massage one transformation line to its core
4. List 10 specific details about them
5. Write a scene where they make a choice that reveals their deep voice

**For an existing character:**
1. Review their dialogue - does it all sound authentic?
2. Find where they're in "reporting voice" vs "deep voice"
3. Add one new specific detail to their checklist
4. Write a transformation line they haven't confronted yet
