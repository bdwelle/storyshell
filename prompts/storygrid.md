# Storygrid Methodology Reference

## Overview

Storygrid is a comprehensive story analysis and construction methodology developed by Shawn Coyne, based on decades of editorial experience. It provides a framework for understanding what makes stories work and how to construct them with precision.

### What is Storygrid?

Storygrid is a professional story analysis framework developed by editor Shawn Coyne. It provides:

1. **Five Commandments** - Universal story structure at every level:
   - Inciting Incident
   - Progressive Complications
   - Crisis (Best Bad Choice)
   - Climax
   - Resolution

2. **Value Tracking** - Every scene shifts a value on a spectrum:
   - Life/Death, Love/Hate, Freedom/Slavery, etc.
   - Opening value → Closing value
   - Positive or negative shift

3. **Genre Requirements** - Each genre has:
   - Obligatory scenes (must have)
   - Conventions (should have)
   - Global value at stake

4. **Story Grid Spreadsheet** - Track every scene:
   - Event, value, polarity, turning point
   - Word count, POV, duration
   - Visual progression analysis

## Core Principles

### Story Structure Levels
   - Global Story (the novel)
   - Act  (3-5 acts made up of chapters)
   - Sequence/Chapter (series of scenes)
   - Scene (individual scenes)
   - Beat (moment-to-moment)

### 1. The Five Commandments of Storytelling

Every larger story unit (scene, sequence, act, or global story) should contain:

#### 1. Inciting Incident
- The event that kicks off the story unit
- Creates an imbalance that demands a response
- Can be causal (caused by character) or coincidental (external force)
- **Scene level**: What starts the scene's conflict?
- **Global level**: What disrupts the protagonist's status quo?

#### 2. Progressive Complications
- Series of escalating obstacles
- Each complication makes the situation worse or more complex
- Forces protagonist toward a crisis point
- Raises stakes and tension
- "Turning point progressions" - revelations, actions, or decisions that complicate

#### 3. Crisis (Best Bad Choice)
- The protagonist's moment of decision
- Should be a **dilemma**: choosing between two negative options OR two positive but mutually exclusive options
- **Irreconcilable goods**: Do I save my friend or complete the mission?
- **Obligatory choice**: The only two options available
- Must be clear to the reader/audience
- The crisis question is binary: A or B?

#### 4. Climax
- The protagonist's choice/action in response to the crisis
- The "answer" to the crisis question
- Must be active (protagonist does something)
- Shows character through choice
- **Scene level**: Decision or action taken
- **Global level**: The big confrontation/choice

#### 5. Resolution
- The immediate consequence of the climax
- New status quo established (but not necessarily stable)
- Sets up the next story unit
- **Scene level**: What changes immediately?
- **Global level**: The denouement, showing the changed world

### 2. Story Values

Every scene operates on a **value spectrum** from positive to negative:

#### Common Value Spectrums

- **Life ←→ Death** (with shades: thriving, comfortable, struggling, endangered, "fate worse than death")
- **Love ←→ Hate** (shades: true love, affection, indifference, contempt, hatred)
- **Freedom ←→ Slavery**
- **Truth ←→ Lie**
- **Justice ←→ Injustice**
- **Knowledge ←→ Ignorance**
- **Success ←→ Failure**
- **Courage ←→ Cowardice**
- **Hope ←→ Despair**

#### Value at Stake

- Each story has a **global value** (e.g., an action story: Life/Death)
- Scenes explore various facets of that value
- **Opening value**: Where the scene starts on the spectrum
- **Closing value**: Where it ends
- **Polarity shift**: Did it move + or -?
- **Charge**: The emotional/stakes intensity of the shift

### 3. Turning Points

A **turning point** is what causes a value shift. Three types:

#### Action Turning Point
- Physical event happens
- Someone does something
- External force acts
- Example: The villain attacks

#### Revelation Turning Point  
- Information is revealed
- Character learns something crucial
- Truth comes to light
- Example: Discovering the mentor is the traitor

#### Decision Turning Point
- Character makes a choice
- Often at crisis moments
- Shows character values
- Example: Choosing to sacrifice themselves

**Principle**: Every scene MUST have at least one turning point that shifts a value. No shift = no scene.

### 4. Story Structure Levels

Stories work on multiple nested levels:
- **IMAGE**: descriptive detail of a 'still' shot during which *nothing happens*
- **MOMENT**: A few seconds, short duration of time
- **IMAGE/MOMENT aka BEAT*: two Bookends with an Image/Moment between them.
- **EVENT** aka SCENE: Longer action consisting of multiple MOMENTS strung together
- **CHAPTER** aka STORYLINE: SCENES strung together to create a chapter-length storyline
- **STORY**: CHAPTERS strung together create the complete book-length narrative arc 

#### Beat
- two Bookends with a descriptive Image-Moment between them. A single bookend typically serves as the end of one Beat and the beginning of the next."
- Bookend: He raised the gun.
- Image-Moment: The bedroom was dark and smelled faintly of smoke. His hat was cocked to one side as always. She held a small mirror in her left hand.
- Bookend: She stepped back, her right calf coming up against the bed frame.
- Image-Moment: The bed was unmade, sheets and pillows all in a tangle. A candle burned on the nightstand. 
- Bookend: He said, "Don't move a muscle, honey, I've got you in my sights." 

#### Event/Scene
- Flowing narrative arc comprised of a series of Beats
- Usually one POV, location, time period
- Strive for a balance of action, dialogue, description, and commentary.
- 1000-3000 words typically

#### Sequence/Chapter/Storyline
- Group of related scenes
- Mini-story with own Five Commandments
- Usually 3-5 scenes
- Example: "The Training Sequence", "The Heist Sequence"

#### Act
- Major structural division containing a group of Sequence/Chapter/Storylines
- Beginning Hook (Act 1)
- Middle Build (Acts 2-3)
- Ending Payoff (Act 3 or Acts 4-5)
- Each act has Five Commandments

#### Global Story
- The entire narrative
- Has its own Five Commandments
- Beginning, Middle, End
- Primary genre determines global value

### 5. Content Genre

The **Content Genre** defines what the story is fundamentally about:

#### Action
- Global value: Life/Death
- Protagonist must survive against antagonist
- Obligatory scenes:
  - Hero at Mercy of Villain
  - Speech in Praise of Villain

### 6. Story Grid Spreadsheet

Track each scene with these elements:

| # | Scene Title | Event | Value | Open | Close | +/- | Turn | POV | Duration | Words |
|---|------------|-------|-------|------|-------|-----|------|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | The Breach | Prisoner must choose to help guards during dome breach | Freedom/Captivity | -3 | -1 | + | Revelation | Alex | 15 min | 1250 |
| 2 | The Plan | Alex uses stolen card to access restricted zone | Freedom/Captivity | -1 | 0 | + | Action | Alex | 30 min | 1800 |

**Columns explained:**
- **#**: Scene number in reading order
- **Scene Title**: Descriptive title
- **Event**: What happens in the scene (one sentence)
- **Value**: What's at stake
- **Open**: Starting value polarity (-5 to +5)
- **Close**: Ending value polarity (-5 to +5)
- **+/-**: Did value improve (+) or worsen (-)?
- **Turn**: Type of turning point (Action/Revelation/Decision)
- **POV**: Point of view character
- **Duration**: Time span of scene
- **Words**: Approximate word count

### 7. Genre Conventions vs. Obligatory Scenes

**Conventions** = Expected elements readers want:
- Action: A clear villain, ticking clock, McGuffin, special skills
- Horror: Isolated setting, vulnerable protagonist, increasing dread
- Love: Two attractive protagonists, barriers to union, misunderstanding

**Obligatory Scenes** = Specific scenes the genre MUST have:
- Action: Hero at mercy of villain, all is lost, hero's sacrifice
- Horror: Monster appears, false ending, final confrontation
- Love: Meet cute, rupture, proof of love, declaration

**Rule**: Meet conventions = genre recognition. Include obligatory scenes = satisfying ending.

Climax: ______________________
Resolution: ______________________

GENRE: ______________
GLOBAL VALUE: ______________
POV: ______________

CONTROLLING IDEA/THEME: ______________
```

## Scene Analysis Workflow

When creating/analyzing a scene, the system guides you through:

1. **Event**: What happens in this scene?
2. **Value at Stake**: What value is being explored? (Life/Death, Love/Hate, etc.)
3. **Opening Value**: Where does the scene start on the value spectrum?
4. **Closing Value**: Where does it end?
5. **Polarity Shift**: +/- (Did it improve or worsen?)
6. **Turning Point**: What causes the shift?
   - Action (physical event)
   - Revelation (information revealed)
   - Decision (character choice)

## Story Analysis Process

### For Existing Stories

1. **Identify the global genre and value**
   - What is this story fundamentally about?
   - Life/Death? Love/Hate? Justice?

2. **Map the Five Commandments at global level**
   - What's the inciting incident?
   - What are the major complications?
   - What's the global crisis?
   - What's the climactic moment?
   - What's the resolution?

3. **Break into acts**
   - Where are the major structural shifts?
   - What are the act-level Five Commandments?

4. **Analyze scenes**
   - What value is at stake in each?
   - Does each scene have a clear shift?
   - What type of turning point?

5. **Create the Story Grid spreadsheet**
   - Track all scenes
   - Look for patterns in value shifts
   - Identify missing obligatory scenes

### For New Stories

1. **Choose your content genre**
   - What type of story are you writing?
   - What's the global value?

2. **Study genre requirements**
   - What are the obligatory scenes?
   - What are the conventions?

3. **Use Foolscap Method**
   - Plan the three major acts
   - Identify Five Commandments for each

4. **Sequence planning**
   - Break acts into 3-5 scene sequences
   - Each sequence has mini Five Commandments

5. **Scene-by-scene planning**
   - Use Story Grid spreadsheet
   - Plan value shifts before writing
   - Ensure clear turning points

6. **Write and revise**
   - Draft scenes with structure in mind
   - Analyze after writing
   - Revise based on Grid analysis

## Common Story Problems (and Storygrid Solutions)

### "My middle sags"
**Diagnosis**: Scenes lack clear value shifts or turning points.
**Solution**: Use Grid to identify scenes without shifts. Add complications or cut scenes.

### "The ending feels flat"
**Diagnosis**: Crisis isn't a true dilemma OR climax is passive.
**Solution**: Make crisis a genuine best bad choice. Make protagonist actively choose.

### "Readers say it's boring"
**Diagnosis**: Too many scenes with positive (+) shifts in a row OR stakes aren't clear.
**Solution**: Alternate positive and negative shifts. Ensure value at stake is clear.

### "I'm stuck/blocked"
**Diagnosis**: You're at a complication point but haven't identified the crisis.
**Solution**: Ask: What are the two worst options for my protagonist right now?

### "My character feels flat"
**Diagnosis**: Character doesn't make active choices at crisis points.
**Solution**: Ensure each crisis forces a decision that reveals character values.

### "Genre doesn't feel right"
**Diagnosis**: Missing obligatory scenes or conventions.
**Solution**: List genre requirements. Check which are missing. Add them.
