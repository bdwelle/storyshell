# Storygrid Methodology Reference

## Overview

Storygrid is a comprehensive story analysis and construction methodology. It provides a framework for understanding what makes stories work and how to construct them with precision.

## Core Principles

### Story Structure Levels
   - Global Story (the novel)
   - Act  (3-5 acts made up of chapters)
   - Sequence/Chapter (series of scenes)
   - Scene (individual scenes)
   - Beat (moment-to-moment)

### 1. The Five Commandments of Storytelling

Every larger story unit (scene, sequence, act, or global story) should contain:

#### 1. Inciting Incident
- The event that kicks off the story unit
- Creates an imbalance that demands a response
- Can be causal (caused by character) or coincidental (external force)
- **Scene level**: What starts the scene's conflict?
- **Global level**: What disrupts the protagonist's status quo?

#### 2. Progressive Complications
- Series of escalating obstacles
- Each complication makes the situation worse or more complex
- Forces protagonist toward a crisis point
- Raises stakes and tension
- "Turning point progressions" - revelations, actions, or decisions that complicate

#### 3. Crisis (Best Bad Choice)
- The protagonist's moment of decision
- Should be a **dilemma**: choosing between two negative options OR two positive but mutually exclusive options
- **Irreconcilable goods**: Do I save my friend or complete the mission?
- **Obligatory choice**: The only two options available
- Must be clear to the reader/audience
- The crisis question is binary: A or B?

#### 4. Climax
- The protagonist's choice/action in response to the crisis
- The "answer" to the crisis question
- Must be active (protagonist does something)
- Shows character through choice
- **Scene level**: Decision or action taken
- **Global level**: The big confrontation/choice

#### 5. Resolution
- The immediate consequence of the climax
- New status quo established (but not necessarily stable)
- Sets up the next story unit
- **Scene level**: What changes immediately?
- **Global level**: The denouement, showing the changed world

### 2. Story Values

Every scene operates on a **value spectrum** from positive to negative:

#### Common Value Spectrums

- **Life ←→ Death** (with shades: thriving, comfortable, struggling, endangered, "fate worse than death")
- **Love ←→ Hate** (shades: true love, affection, indifference, contempt, hatred)
- **Freedom ←→ Slavery**
- **Truth ←→ Lie**
- **Justice ←→ Injustice**
- **Knowledge ←→ Ignorance**
- **Success ←→ Failure**
- **Courage ←→ Cowardice**
- **Hope ←→ Despair**

#### Value at Stake

- Each story has a **global value** (e.g., an action story: Life/Death)
- Scenes explore various facets of that value
- **Opening value**: Where the scene starts on the spectrum
- **Closing value**: Where it ends
- **Polarity shift**: Did it move + or -?
- **Charge**: The emotional/stakes intensity of the shift

### 3. Turning Points

A **turning point** is what causes a value shift. Three types:

#### Action Turning Point
- Physical event happens
- Someone does something
- External force acts
- Example: The villain attacks

#### Revelation Turning Point  
- Information is revealed
- Character learns something crucial
- Truth comes to light
- Example: Discovering the mentor is the traitor

#### Decision Turning Point
- Character makes a choice
- Often at crisis moments
- Shows character values
- Example: Choosing to sacrifice themselves

**Principle**: Every scene MUST have at least one turning point that shifts a value. No shift = no scene.
