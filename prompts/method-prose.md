# Method Prose Writing

Use this additional methodology primarily when prose. 

### Tonal Dynamics 

Tonal dynamics involves using various techniques to create/alter the tone of the narrative. "a work of prose contains inner tensions that resolve themselves before the end... Dynamic tonal effects, tonal shifts, play on our psyche the same way that tonal changes in music keep us hooked. ...Imagine a circus tent...the central pols is the basic voice: writing like you talk. It has the natural rhythms of the spoken voice shorn of literary trappings. Now imagine other poles radiating out from the center, over which the tent (of the finished piece) is draped. Each pole represents one of the other tonal voices that are used by writers in various combinations... "

**Choose when to use these various techniques based on the feeling you want to create in the Image/Moment, Beat, or Scene.** 

**Techniques of tonal dynamics**
1. **Dreaded Association** 
2. **Straight Talk** 
3. **Lost World** 
4. **Read & Sung** 
5. **Teeth & Mouth** 
6. **Surrealism**

#### Dreaded Association (DA)

**Purpose:** Accessing the right brain, creating impressionistic/expressionistic effects, breaking out of logical linear thinking

**Why "Dreaded"?**
> "It was originally called the association exercise and when I would assign it to people... they would get notes from their mother as to why they were sick and couldn't come to class because they would dread it."

…DA is psychovisual association:
		1. follow the stream-of-consciousness to a normal, logical association, e.g. from “cow” to “horse”
		2. focus on the image of the horse. SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. Not just the image of the horse, but the whole scene. Where is the horse? Use Image-Moment to imagine the whole picture.
		3. Notice the other “words” in the picture, e.g. “boots,” “plastic whistle”, “Model-T Ford”, and then pick one of those. “Cow” → “Model-T” That’s your “dreaded” association.
		- DA is Defamiliarization or ostranenie

		- DA is like [Clanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanging)

**The Effect:**
> "You've got Froggy the Gremlin on your shoulder whispering random words into your ear. When you read the piece back to yourself aloud, you'll be surprised how often the word makes more sense than anything you could have written with your logical mind, with the left side of your brain."

**What Happens:**
- Wild accidents
- Unexpected juxtapositions
- Surreal moments
- The left brain gets mixed up
- Right brain associations create surprising truths
- "Absorb" the associated word - let it influence what comes next

**Example from text (by Rich Manners):**
A passage about bicycle riding that suddenly includes words like "fatal garbage," "kool-aid," "terrorists," "urinals," "yogurt," "velvet," "fertilizer" - creating a dreamlike, impressionistic piece that somehow works.

**When to Use:**
> "Whether it be madness or hysteria or disassociation, there's a swirl of sensation during performance that creates something unexpected... The scene might involve a car accident, a character in the throes of a flashback or hallucinatory drug, etc."

#### Straight Talk 

Description: Speak directly & informally to the reader as if introducing a joke, campfire story—or the straight truth. 

**Purpose:** Grab their attention. Break the fourth wall. 

Usage: don't embed Straight Talk in dialouge; use it only when one character is speaking. The ST should come from the narrator. 

** Examples**
"I wanna tell you a story..."
"Hey, check this out"
"You’re not gonna like this, but…"
writers and works like: _Huckleberry Finn_, _Catcher in the Rye_,

#### Lost World 

Description: ornate, embellished, wordy performance of lush, dense, poetic, musical syntax and diction. 

**Purpose:** Get the reader 'lost' in your narrative world

** Examples**
Proust, Rimbaud, Faulkner, Styron, _The Autumn of the Patriarch_ by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, _Old Man, Dead in a Room_ by Charles Bukowski 

---

#### Read & Sung

Description: parallel syntax, repetition of words and phrases (at least three times), chant, suspended sentences, alternate short and long phrases. "preacher" voice. Several lines held together by a common meaning or repetition of words or set phrases. Anaphora. 

Usage: "Use long lines to build a passionate rhythm, then **repeat key phrases to beat the drum of the heart.**" (Advanced Method Writing p57)
"The sentence unfolds gradually, not unlike musical variations on a theme, so that the thought contained in the subject/verb/ group only emerges at the sentence's conclusion. In the best of them, it is often **a phrase or a word whose sound as final as a cymbal crash.**" (Advanced Method Writing p67)

**Purpose:** Express through rhythm and the lyrical power of 'song'

** Examples**
Herman Melville, Ginsburg's _Howl_, _Leaves of Grass_ by Walt Whitman, _I Have a Dream_ by Martin Luther King, Jr.

#### Teeth & Mouth

**Purpose:** connect to the readers' _gut_. Creates an energized field. Give your mouth a workout. AVOID ALLITERATION. Don't do a bunch of words all having the same first sound, the silly syncopation of slithering snakes sending sorrowful signals to Saturn. ... **Bite into the words, crack open the phrases, clutter the sentences with escapades of turbulent frescoes as you scratch one word at a time across the charred landscape of the the defective page.**" (Advanced Method Writing p125)

Description: It's not another voice. It's an aspect of the other voices. 

Usage: 
Hard consonants—fricatives—create an energized field 
B C CH D F G H J L K N P Q S SH T X Z 
(B G L P S are borderline)

Think of where you want the reader’s mouth to go next — the shape of their face and sound of the words. 

** levels of Teeth & Mouth**
1) the average reader wouldn’t notice, but we would. Use this 96% of the time. 
2) the average reader would notice. Use this 3% of the time. 
3) so many hard consonants that it would be difficult to make sentences. 1% of the time. 

Examples: _Easter_ by Frank O'Hara. _Altarwise by Owl-Light_ by Dylan Thomas.

#### Surrealism

Description: connect to the reader’s mind. Put yourself in a state where you receive these images and thoughts from that inner dictation… use all the images that flood your mind. the "collision of objects, images, ideas to create something bizzare and unreal that creates a sense of hyper-reality, or surrealism." "Surrealism attempts to express in art the working of the unconsicous." ...expresses "a willingness to experience anything."

**Purpose:** express the surreal 

** Examples**
Dream + reality = surreality. Dali.
